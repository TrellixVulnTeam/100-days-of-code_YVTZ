"""
You have been given a collection of text messages some of which are spam and
some of which are not-spam (i.e. ham).

Find the number of tokens across all messages that contain a digit. For example
if you have the message "hi 3 there a5a", you'll return 2.

The data is derived from a collection of SMS messages released publicly, available in its original form here:
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset
http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/.
