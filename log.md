# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Created a basic Dash app that tells you if Chick-Fil-A is open.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, specially aligning all the elements in a div.

### Day 2: January 2, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Finished putting together the CSS for the webapp.

**Thoughts:** I ended up figuring out how to align each element in each of the divs. Not my fav thing, CSS was somewhat painful.

### Day 3: January 3, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Putting together a `seaborn` kdeplot using the data from the Human Freedom Index 2020.

**Thoughts:** I still need to fix some small details like axes ticks and axis labels.

### Day 4: January 4, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Finished putting together a `seaborn` kdeplot using the data from the Human Freedom Index 2020.

**Thoughts:** I learned how `FacetGrid` works. At first it was kind of confusing, but once you start playing around with it, you get a sense of what to expect and how to customize each subplot.

### Day 5: January 5, 2021
**Today's Progress**: I decided I would make the whole data gathering, cleaning, and analysis for the [Human Freedom Index](https://cato.org/hfi) automatic.

**Thoughts:** I ran into some issues because in order to download many of the datasets you have to sign in. What I'll do next is 
download all the datasets manually, and then start from there. It was worth trying, though.

### Day 6: January 6, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Re-thinking my #100DaysOfCode journey. I'll be focusing on strengthening my machine learning skills
through different exercises that include decision trees, ransom forest, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, etc.
