# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Created a basic Dash app that tells you if Chick-Fil-A is open.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, specially aligning all the elements in a div.

### Day 2: January 2, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Finished putting together the CSS for the webapp.

**Thoughts:** I ended up figuring out how to align each element in each of the divs. Not my fav thing, CSS was somewhat painful.

### Day 3: January 3, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Putting together a `seaborn` kdeplot using the data from the Human Freedom Index 2020.

**Thoughts:** I still need to fix some small details like axes ticks and axis labels.
